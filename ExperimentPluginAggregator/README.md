# ExperimentPluginAggregator

This Experiment target acts as a simple Aggregator for the data produced by the other plugins in the user's phone.

What it does is merge all measurements to a single measurement and uploads them to the user's phone.

use the jar in the base dir directly if your experiment needs to do no extra calculations.
